# Benchmarks

Reproducible workloads for measuring causal savings, overhead, queues, additional compute, and behavior under failure.

Seeds, images, toolchains, runner classes, and digests are part of the evidence. A benchmark never authorizes a security capability.

[`beta-v1.yaml`](./beta-v1.yaml) is the materialized `F0-032`
machine-readable workload, seed, budget, and fault matrix. Its interpretation
belongs in [`specs/benchmark-beta-v1.md`](../specs/benchmark-beta-v1.md).

The JSON-compatible YAML is validated by `./dev/check-beta-benchmark`. That
command checks identity and completeness; it does not execute the sustained or
soak profiles.

## Walking-skeleton overhead evidence

[`results/ws-009-golden-lane.json`](./results/ws-009-golden-lane.json) is the
first strict, descriptive `WS-009` observation. It contains four alternating
native/wrapper pairs, retains the first pair and signed negative differences,
and binds the exact runner contract, metric catalog, envelope, launcher,
server, and plugin digests. It is not causal evidence and does not activate a
promotion gate.

The report is produced only by the strict 4-vCPU/16-GiB golden-container path
and is subsequently validated without being rewritten:

```bash
./dev/run-golden-lane-container --require-runner-class
```

The measurement contract lives in
[`specs/walking-skeleton-overhead-v1.md`](../specs/walking-skeleton-overhead-v1.md).
