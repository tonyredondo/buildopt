# Development tools

Reproducible entrypoints for bootstrap, diagnostics, and local execution.

## Toolchain lock

[`toolchains.lock.yaml`](./toolchains.lock.yaml) is the source of truth for downloadable development toolchains on the initial `linux-amd64` platform. It is JSON-compatible YAML 1.2 so the Phase 0 validator can parse it with `jq` before the repository adopts a YAML library.

Every artifact records an exact version, platform, provider, immutable HTTPS URL, SHA-256, adoption status, and the tracker items that require it. Adoption status has these meanings:

- `required`: accepted for the listed tracker items, although provisioning and smoke evidence may still be pending.
- `candidate`: pinned for evaluation but not adopted until its listed decision gate closes.
- `optional`: not required by the core product and provisioned only for its bounded workstream.

Presence in the lock does not close a provisioning item or activate a tool. `dev/bootstrap` will materialize these entries under the repository-local `.tools/` root by default; `dev/doctor` and `dev/run` will verify or consume that state in `ENV-002..012`. These scripts must not use `sudo` or replace global toolchains.

Gradle and the golden container are intentionally delegated to their existing sources of truth:

- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` owns the Gradle distribution and checksum.
- `specs/golden-lane-runner-v1.json` owns the golden image and runner contract.

Operating-system capabilities and externally supplied commands such as Docker, Git, `curl`, `jq`, `tar`, and `unzip` are host requirements, not downloadable artifacts in this lock. The read-only `dev/doctor` will report them without installing or modifying them.

## Doctor

`dev/doctor` inventories the active workstation without changing files, installing packages, starting services, or downloading artifacts. It reports:

- detected operating system, architecture, kernel, CPU, memory, workspace filesystem, and available bytes;
- required host-command paths and versions;
- Docker client/daemon state, versions, storage driver, cgroup version, and resource-limit capabilities;
- observable cgroup, user-namespace, seccomp-process, and Landlock-securityfs state;
- the active `PATH` winner and observed version for each locked toolchain.

The capability fields are inventory only. They do not qualify Landlock, seccomp, or complete process-tree enforcement for C1. Toolchain states are `MATCH`, `MISMATCH`, `MISSING`, or `UNPROBED`; until their own `ENV-*` gates close, they do not make the doctor fail.

Use the human-readable report interactively:

```bash
./dev/doctor
```

Use the versioned JSON report for automation:

```bash
./dev/doctor --json
```

The report schema version is `buildopt.dev/doctor-report/v1`. Exit codes are stable:

| Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| `0` | The report was generated and every required host check passed; deferred checks may warn. |
| `1` | The report was generated and at least one required host check failed. |
| `64` | Invalid command-line usage. |
| `70` | The report could not be generated because its lock or required JSON machinery was unavailable or invalid. |

The doctor deliberately probes the active `PATH` and repository state; it does not search arbitrary home directories or infer that an inactive installation is usable. `dev/run` will supply the project-local `PATH` when `ENV-003` and later provisioning items materialize it.

## Validation

Run the lock and doctor contract tests from the repository root:

```bash
./dev/check-toolchains-lock
./dev/test-doctor
```

The validator rejects malformed schema versions, duplicate identities or URLs, unknown platforms, non-HTTPS sources, invalid SHA-256 values, unsupported artifact kinds, and missing or malformed tracker references.

The doctor tests exercise successful and failed host reports, JSON shape, exit codes `0`, `1`, `64`, and `70`, JDK `java`/`javac` probes, and the read-only working-tree invariant.

## Update policy

Toolchain updates are atomic repository changes:

1. Select an exact upstream release from the official project or its official release repository; moving aliases such as `latest` are forbidden.
2. Record the new version, platform, provider, immutable URL, and upstream SHA-256 in the same change.
3. Keep local paths, usernames, package-manager locations, credentials, mirrors, and workstation-specific state out of the lock.
4. Verify the downloaded bytes against the recorded SHA-256 before provisioning or changing adoption state.
5. Run `./dev/check-toolchains-lock` and every smoke test affected by the tool before updating tracker evidence.

Adding a platform or changing an adopted provider requires explicit compatibility evidence. A checksum-only change for the same immutable URL is treated as a supply-chain conflict and must not be accepted without resolving the upstream discrepancy.
